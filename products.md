## EasyVotePro

EasyVotePro is a plugin designed to integrate player voting into gaming servers, seamlessly supporting several popular voting sites such as Rust-Servers.net and GamesFinder.net. This plugin facilitates rewarding players for their votes, with a system that allows for customizable reward tiers based on the number of votes received. Players can view vote links directly from the chat, enhancing user interaction without the need for additional notes or permissions. The plugin simplifies reward management by utilizing commands for rewarding players, which can be tailored to suit the needs of each server.

Additionally, EasyVotePro offers a set of useful commands for maintaining and understanding player vote status, such as clearing or setting vote counts. Notification features can be enhanced through optional plugins like UINotify/Notify and Discord Embeds, providing players with timely reminders and updates about their voting activities. The plugin is currently in beta, so users are encouraged to test its functionalities in a controlled environment to ensure smooth operation.
